# Dashboard Server

Welcome to the **Dashboard Server**! üéâ This server is designed to streamline the creation and management of multiple dashboards by centralizing user accounts and data across different dashboard types. Whether you're managing a dashboard for your blog, office, or online store, this server enables you to handle everything from one central location. üåê

---

## Overview

The Dashboard Server centralizes and simplifies dashboard creation, eliminating the need for separate servers for each dashboard application. By managing different dashboard types (e.g., `server.blogs.quickstoredashboard.com`, `server.office.quickstoredashboard.com`) on a single server, we reduce redundancy and increase operational efficiency.

The server is structured around two primary components:

1. **Accounts Collection**: Manages user accounts across various dashboard types. Each user is uniquely identified by a `user_id`, which links to the data stored in other collections.
2. **Data Collection**: Stores all user-generated data, regardless of the dashboard type. Data entries include a `dashboard_type` identifier (e.g., `sites`, `office`, `stores`) and a `user_id` to associate data with the user.

With this structure, multiple dashboards (e.g., `dashboards.quickstoredashboard.com`, `specific_dashboard.dashboards.com`) can be managed centrally. This approach simplifies both backend and frontend operations while keeping the frontend dashboard panel under development. üöÄ

## Data Structure

The data is organized in the following structure:

````css
dashboards -> Creates and fetches accounts based on user_id
dashboard.dashboards -> Manages data of different dashboard types (e.g., sites, office, stores)
